# Python Examples for API Interactions

Here some basic python examples that you can leverage on how to interact with U.S. Bank's apis.

## Set Up

If you're using **PyCharm**, make sure that you have a virtual environment so that we can install
python packages specific to your project.

If you're using another tool like **Visual Studio Code**, make sure that you create a virtual
environment for your project.

Once you have your project open, make sure you install the following libraries using `pip`:

* requests
* python-dotenv

You can also install both of this running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you're using this project).
